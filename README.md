## Jamie's Developer Blog
My name is **Jamie Oglethorpe**, and this is my development blog.

I am the Continuous Integration Architect for [Ecentric Payment Systems](http://www.ecentric.co.za/) and am currently designing processes which will allow us to move our projects from our in-house CI process to *Visual Studio Team Services* (VSTS) in the cloud. We offer customizable payment reconciliation services, and our databases are designed with extensive reuse of features.

My aim is to make the developers experience as uniform as possible. We are a **Microsoft** shop, which means that our primary tool must be Visual Studio and the use of *NuGet* for shared features and versioning.

My challenge is to make use of *NuGet* for SQL Server projects, a capability Microsoft does not support at present.
