## What Visual Studio Does

When you add a PowerShell project to a solution in Visual Studio you are offered the choice of creating a 
**PowerShell Module Project** or a *PowerShell Script Project.**

### PowerShell Module Project

VS creates a script module (.psm1 file), a module manifest (.psd1 file) and a tests script (.test.ps1 file)

### PowerShell Script Project

VS creates a script (.ps1 file)

### PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio

This is the basic PowerShell extension to Visual Studio, and is the version I discuss here. It can be installed in Visual Studio 
by selecting **Tools/Extensions and Updates...** in the VS menu, then selecting Online and typing powershell in the *Search* box, 
and typing *powershell* and enter. PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio should be at the top of the list. Click on **Download** and 
follow the directions.

### PowerShell Pro Tools for Visual Studio

This is an enhanced extension that adds a number of powerful tools for manipulating PowerShell modules. There is a small overlap between the tools I will be describing and those provided by this extension.
